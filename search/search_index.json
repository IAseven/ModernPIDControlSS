It is sometimes rated as a simple and old control algorithm. Quite truly, the overview representation is simple, but its design is not so. From the lens of neuroscience and psychology, the PID law is the simplest representation of active inference or perceptual control in nature. The PID law, actively tries to make inference to minimize the deviation of a perceived controllable behaviour from the expected behaviour. In systems and control, this law is used as an algorithm for robust feedback control. It infers the necessary control input u u to a dynamical system, to reach an achievable expected output r r of the dynamical system. This means that the PID law is an artificial intelligence (AI) for inference. It represents the complex intelligence of inference in nature. Notably, Nicolai Minorsky, who proposed the seminal theoretical representation of the PID realised this in the early nineties. An important design question is: a general framework for this AI architecture and its parameters for guaranteed stable inference (control). Two main problems in this AI exist. The representation, and the design of AI. Research in the control literature has mostly focused on the latter. Summary Using modern control and signal processing theory, this library provides for practical use, a simple but robust realization of the PID law represented in critic form. The features implemented are compactly listed in the about page. The problem of automatic design of the PID law for control is approached from the viewpoint of the 'closed PID-loop model'. For a more technical understanding of this automatic tuning design, read the preprint at ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00314 ). Also, please see the library license for further details on library use. PID Law: Representation \u00b6 The PID Law can be represented as a critic function: u = f(r,y) u = f(r,y) $$ u=f(r,y)=\\lambda_p\\,u_p + \\lambda_i\\,u_i + \\lambda_d\\,u_d $$ Usecase \u00b6 The tuning method included in this library as default is the CPLMFC. You can also use this library without using the tuner included (this usecase example will be added later). The usecase example provides a general overview for using the library for control. It is divided into three steps. The first two steps is to respectively obtain the maximum value of the output to be controlled and obtain the discrete-time step the output settles to an average value. The last step uses information from the last two steps to run the automatic algorithm See the step illustrations below. The aim is to control the observed temperature using a system driven by a PWM input.

The design and realization of a modern controller should inherently address these issues. For example, Issue 1 is necessary for discrete-time implementation (software). Issue 2 is covered by digital signal-processing information theory in relation to Issue 1. Issue 3 is covered by the two-degree of freedom control structure. Issue 4 is covered by modern anti-windup synthesis. Issue 5 is covered by similarly treating the effect of parameter changes as a wind-up problem. In this library, the realization of the PID control algorithm addresses all these issues internally as part of the control design.

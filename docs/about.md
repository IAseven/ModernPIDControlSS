# About

This realization of the PID control algorithm has all the practical problems of PID control implementation,
internally addressed in the PID algorithm itself.

It features:

1. Simplified Bilinear Discretization for Integration and Differentiation

2. Filtering: Information theory perspective of Signal processing

3. Critic Contributions

4. Two Degree-of-Freedom Control Structure

5. Automatic Anti-windup Control

6. Real-time Tuning: Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control


## Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control
**Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control** is the method used  
to tune the PID is detailed in this paper **CPLMFC**.
For more details on the theory, see [Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00314).

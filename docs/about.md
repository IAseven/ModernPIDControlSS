# About

This realization of the PID control algorithm has all the practical problems of PID control implementation,
internally addressed in the PID algorithm itself.

It features:

1. Simplified Bilinear Discretization for Integration and Differentiation

2. Individual Critic Contributions Control

3. Two Degree-of-Freedom Control

4. Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control

5. Automatic Anti-windup Control


## What is Tuning
**Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control** is the method used  
to tune the PID is detailed in this paper **CPLMFC**.
For more details on the theory, see [Closed PID-Loop Model Following Control Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00314).
